# React-Snippet-Storage
A simple web app for saving code snippets to reuse easily. React / Express / MongoDB / Node

## Purpose
A bit of quick practice using React. Segregating frontend & backend in this project to start a good habit. Will be using [npm concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) configured to start both backend and frontend at the same time.
