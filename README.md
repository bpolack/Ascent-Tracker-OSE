# React-Snippet-Storage
A simple web app for saving code snippets to reuse easily. React / Express / MongoDB / Node

## Purpose
A bit of quick practice using React. Although small, Frontend & backend of this project are separated for simplicity. For ease of use, in a test environment use [npm concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) configured to start both backend and frontend at the same time.

## Roadmap

1. Express/Mongo setup with simple JWT authentication :white_check_mark:
2. Backend REST API created with required user and snippet routes :white_check_mark:
3. React setup and config
4. Create user account control panel to allow signup / login / password change
5. Add/View/Search/Edit/Remove Code Snippets from user snippet panel
